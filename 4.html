    <!---Line Break--->
    Two roads diverged in a yellow wood,
    <br>
    And sorry I could not travel both
    <br>
    And be one traveler, long I stood
    <br>
    And looked down one as far as I could
    <br>
    To where it bent in the undergrowth;
    <br>
    <br>
    Then took the other, as just as fair,
    <br>
    And having perhaps the better claim
    <br>
    Because it was grassy and wanted wear,
    <br>
    Though as for that the passing there
    <br>
    Had worn them really about the same,
    <br>

    <!---Line with Break--->
    <p>
      And both that morning equally lay
      <hr>
      In leaves no step had trodden black.

    <!---Spacing format--->
    <pre>
      Oh, I kept the first for another day!
          Yet knowing how way leads on to way
            I doubted if I should ever come back.

          what a birthday present!

    <!---USing Code inside para--->
    <p>You shall be telling this with a sigh Somewhere ages and ages hence:
    Two roads diverged in a wood,And that <code>{made all the difference.}</code></p>
